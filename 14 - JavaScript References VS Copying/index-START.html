			let name2 = name;
			// console.log(name, name2); // 'Kathleen', 'Kathleen'
			name = 'Katie';
			// console.log(name, name2); // 'Katie', 'Kathleen'

			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

			// and we want to make a copy of it.
			const team = players;
			console.log({ players }, { team }); // same array

			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			// team[3] = 'Lux';
			// if you update an array it will always reference back

			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			const team2 = players.slice(); // return the whole array

			// one way

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			const team3 = [].concat(players);

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team4 = [...players];
			team4[3] = 'heee haww';
			console.log(team4);

			const team5 = Array.from(players);

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: 'Wes Bos',
				age: 80,
			};

			// and think we make a copy:

			// how do we take a copy instead?

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
